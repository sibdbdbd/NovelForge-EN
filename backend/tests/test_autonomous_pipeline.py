"""Autonomous pipeline: EPUB upload -> storyline options -> selection -> finished novel, with no live model.

A deterministic ``FakeClient`` plays every model role. It also injects faults
the pipeline must catch: a malformed first storyline batch (format repair), a
storyline that leaks source entities (originality gate), two near-identical
storylines (diversity gate), one architecture that fails validation
(architect repair round), and a draft that leaks a source name (chapter repair).
The job is interrupted after chapter 2 and resumed in a fresh runner to prove
restart safety without duplicated chapters or canon.
